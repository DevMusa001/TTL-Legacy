# Disaster Recovery Runbook

This runbook covers emergency procedures for TTL-Legacy operators. Follow each section in order during an incident.

---

## Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| P0 — Critical | Active fund loss or contract exploit | Immediate |
| P1 — High | Contract frozen, funds inaccessible | < 1 hour |
| P2 — Medium | Degraded functionality, no fund risk | < 4 hours |
| P3 — Low | Minor issues, monitoring alerts | < 24 hours |

---

## 1. Emergency Contract Pause

Use when an exploit or critical bug is detected.

**Who can act**: Admin key holder only.

```bash
# Pause the contract immediately
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_TTL_VAULT \
  --network $STELLAR_NETWORK \
  --source $DEPLOYER_IDENTITY \
  -- pause
```

**Verify pause is active:**

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_TTL_VAULT \
  --network $STELLAR_NETWORK \
  -- is_paused
# Expected: true
```

**Effects of pause**: `deposit`, `withdraw`, `check_in`, and `trigger_release` all revert. Vault state is preserved. Funds are not moved.

**To unpause** (only after root cause is resolved):

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_TTL_VAULT \
  --network $STELLAR_NETWORK \
  --source $DEPLOYER_IDENTITY \
  -- unpause
```

---

## 2. Emergency Withdrawal

Use when a specific vault's funds must be recovered by the owner before a release is triggered.

**Who can act**: Vault owner only (requires owner auth).

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_TTL_VAULT \
  --network $STELLAR_NETWORK \
  --source <owner-identity> \
  -- withdraw \
  --vault_id <VAULT_ID> \
  --to <owner-address> \
  --amount <amount-in-stroops>
```

> The contract must **not** be paused for this to succeed. If the contract is paused, unpause first (admin action), perform the withdrawal, then re-pause if needed.

---

## 3. Archived Vault Recovery

Soroban archives persistent entries when their TTL expires. If a vault is archived before `trigger_release` is called, use the following procedure.

**Step 1 — Detect archival:**

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_TTL_VAULT \
  --network $STELLAR_NETWORK \
  -- get_archived_vault_info \
  --vault_id <VAULT_ID>
# Returns Some(ArchivedVaultInfo) if archived, None if live
```

**Step 2 — Restore the vault:**

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_TTL_VAULT \
  --network $STELLAR_NETWORK \
  --source <any-identity> \
  -- restore_vault \
  --vault_id <VAULT_ID>
```

`restore_vault` re-extends the persistent entry TTL so the vault becomes accessible again. `trigger_release` automatically attempts restoration before transferring funds.

**Step 3 — Verify restoration:**

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_TTL_VAULT \
  --network $STELLAR_NETWORK \
  -- get_vault \
  --vault_id <VAULT_ID>
# Should return vault data without error
```

---

## 4. Data Recovery

If contract state is suspected to be corrupted or inconsistent:

1. **Do not unpause** until the state is verified.
2. Query all affected vaults using `get_vault` and compare against off-chain records.
3. Use `get_release_status` to confirm vault statuses.
4. If a vault shows `Released` but funds were not transferred, check the Stellar transaction history for the contract address.
5. Contact the Stellar Development Foundation support if ledger-level data recovery is needed.

---

## 5. Admin Key Rotation

If the admin key is compromised:

```bash
# Step 1: Propose new admin (current admin must sign)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_TTL_VAULT \
  --network $STELLAR_NETWORK \
  --source $DEPLOYER_IDENTITY \
  -- propose_admin \
  --new_admin <new-admin-address>

# Step 2: New admin accepts (new admin must sign)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_TTL_VAULT \
  --network $STELLAR_NETWORK \
  --source <new-admin-identity> \
  -- accept_admin
```

If the current admin key is already compromised and cannot sign, the contract must be redeployed. Coordinate with vault owners to migrate funds via `withdraw` before redeployment.

---

## 6. Contact Escalation

| Role | Contact | When to Escalate |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| On-call operator | Internal team channel | Any P0/P1 incident |
| Security team | security@ttl-legacy.example.com | Suspected exploit or key compromise |
| Stellar SDF support | https://stellar.org/developers | Ledger-level or network issues |
| External auditor | (contract-specific contact) | Unresolved critical findings |

Escalate to the next level if no response within 30 minutes for P0 incidents.

## 7. User Communication Templates

### Planned Maintenance

> **[TTL-Legacy] Scheduled Maintenance — [DATE] [TIME] UTC**
>
> We will be performing scheduled maintenance on the TTL-Legacy contract. During this window, vault operations (deposit, withdraw, check-in, release) will be temporarily unavailable.
>
> Expected duration: [DURATION]
> Your vault state and funds are safe and will be fully accessible after maintenance.

### Unplanned Outage

> **[TTL-Legacy] Service Disruption — [DATE] [TIME] UTC**
>
> We are currently investigating an issue affecting vault operations. As a precaution, the contract has been paused to protect user funds.
>
> No funds have been lost. We will provide an update within [TIMEFRAME].
> For urgent inquiries: security@ttl-legacy.example.com

### All-Clear

> **[TTL-Legacy] Service Restored — [DATE] [TIME] UTC**
>
> The issue has been resolved and the contract is fully operational. All vault operations are available.
>
> A full post-incident report will be published within 72 hours.

## 8. Post-Incident Review

Complete within 72 hours of incident resolution.

**Required sections:**

1. **Timeline** — Chronological log of events from detection to resolution
2. **Root Cause** — Technical description of what went wrong
3. **Impact** — Vaults affected, funds at risk, user impact
4. **Response Actions** — Steps taken and who took them
5. **Lessons Learned** — What worked, what didn't
6. **Action Items** — Concrete follow-up tasks with owners and due dates

Publish the report as a GitHub Security Advisory or in the project's incident log.

## 9. Automated Disaster Recovery Scripts

> Issue #1147: Automate Disaster Recovery Runbook Steps as CI/CD Scripts

The manual steps in sections 1–4 are complemented by two automation scripts
and a nightly CI/CD workflow that reduce human error during incidents.

### `scripts/dr_backup.sh`

Snapshots the contract state and backend database to an S3-compatible bucket.

```bash
# Required environment variables
export DR_S3_BUCKET=my-ttl-legacy-dr
export DR_S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com
export CONTRACT_TTL_VAULT=<contract-id>
export STELLAR_NETWORK=mainnet
export DR_DB_PATH=/var/lib/ttl-legacy/backend.db

# Dry-run (prints actions without executing)
./scripts/dr_backup.sh --dry-run

# Live backup
./scripts/dr_backup.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Exports contract state via `stellar contract read`
2. Creates a hot SQLite snapshot using `.backup` command
3. Uploads contract state JSON, database snapshot, and WASM artefact to
   `s3://<DR_S3_BUCKET>/backups/<TIMESTAMP>/`
4. Writes a `manifest.json` with artefact paths and metadata

### `scripts/dr_restore.sh`

Restores the database from a snapshot and re-deploys the contract from a
backed-up WASM.

```bash
# Required environment variables (same as backup, plus DEPLOYER_IDENTITY)
export DEPLOYER_IDENTITY=deployer-mainnet

# Dry-run first to verify what will happen
./scripts/dr_restore.sh --backup-prefix backups/20260727T020000Z --dry-run

# Live restore
./scripts/dr_restore.sh --backup-prefix backups/20260727T020000Z
```

**What it does:**
1. Downloads the backup manifest to confirm the target network
2. Restores the database (backs up the existing file first)
3. Re-deploys the contract WASM via `stellar contract deploy`
4. Verifies the restored database is readable

### Nightly Backup Workflow

The nightly backup is automated via `.github/workflows/dr-backup.yml` which runs at
02:00 UTC every day. It can also be triggered manually via the GitHub Actions UI
with an optional dry-run flag.

**Required repository secrets:**

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `DR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS access key with S3 write permissions |
| `DR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret key |
| `DR_AWS_REGION` | AWS region (e.g. `us-east-1`) |
| `DR_S3_BUCKET` | S3 bucket name |
| `DR_S3_ENDPOINT` | S3 endpoint URL |
| `CONTRACT_TTL_VAULT` | Deployed contract address |
| `DR_DB_PATH` | Path to the backend database on the runner |

If the backup fails, the workflow automatically opens a GitHub issue labelled
`disaster-recovery` and `bug` for visibility.
